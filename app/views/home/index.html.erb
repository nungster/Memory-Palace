<h3>The Memory Palace</h3>

          The Memory Palace, or Method of Loci, is a mnemonic device based on the fact that we’re extremely
          good at remembering places we know.  A ‘Memory Palace’ is a metaphor for any well-known place that
          you’re able to easily visualize and recall. It can be the inside of your home, or maybe the route
          you take every day to work. That familiar place will be your guide to store and recall any kind of
          information.
